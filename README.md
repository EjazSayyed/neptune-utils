# Develop a graph database app using Amazon Neptune

This Code Pattern contains sample data and code for running a Twitter-like application in Amazon Neptune. The utility code illustrates how to use Amazon Neptune APIs, ingest data, and query graph. Developers can use or modify the code to build and operate their custom graph applications, or create similar java and groovy files to interact with Amazon Neptune.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:
* Generate a synthetic graph dataset
* Upload graph dataset to Amazon S3
* Use Amazon Neptune Bulk Loader to import graph data in csv files into Amazon Neptune graph database
* Query and update graph data using Apache Gremlin Console and REST API

## Flow
Prerequisites:
-Provision Amazon Neptune Cluster (single node)
-Create Amazon S3 bucket 
-Provision an Amazon EC2 instance with Instance Profile that allows to read/write to Amazon S3
-Install and configure Java and Maven on the above EC2 instance. For more details please visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/access-graph-gremlin-java.html. Follow previous doc link upto step#4.
-Install Apache Tinkerpop Gremlin client and configure the connectivity to Amazon Neptune as described here - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/access-graph-gremlin-console.html

1. The user downloads neptune-utils from this gitHub repo
2. The user generates Twitter sample data using Neptune utilities (in Amazon S3)
3. The user loads this data into Amazon Neptune using Amazon Neptune Bulk Loader utility
4. The user makes search queries and update the graph using Apache Tinkerpop Gremlin client

## Included components

* [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/): An open source, scalable, high availability database.
* [JanusGraph](http://janusgraph.org/): A highly scalable graph database optimized for storing and querying large graphs.

## Featured technologies
* [Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Information_Management_System#.22Full_Function.22_databases): Repository for storing and managing collections of data.
* [Java](https://java.com/en/): A secure, object-oriented programming language for creating applications.


# Steps
## Run locally
1. [Install prerequisites](#1-install-prerequisites)
2. [Clone the repo](#2-clone-the-repo)
3. [Generate the graph sample](#3-generate-the-graph-sample)
4. [Load schema and import data](#4-load-schema-and-import-data)
5. [Run interactive remote queries](#5-run-interactive-remote-queries)

### 1. Install prerequisites
> NOTE: These prerequisites can be installed on one server. The instructions are written for Cassandra 3.10 and ElasticSearch 5.3.0 on Linux. Newer versions should work, but might not have been tested. The folder structures on Mac can be different. Check Cassandra and ElasticSearch official documentations for details.

Install Cassandra 3.10 on the storage server. Make the following changes in `/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml` and restart Cassandra.

```
start_rpc: true
rpc_address: 0.0.0.0
rpc_port: 9160
broadcast_rpc_address: x.x.x.x (your storage server ip)
```

Install ElasticSearch 5.3.0 on the index server. Make the following changes in `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` and restart ElasticSearch.

```
network.host: x.x.x.x (your index server ip)
```

Install JanusGraph on the graph server:
* Install java, maven, git
* Run `git clone https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph.git`
* Run the following commands in the `janusgraph` folder:
```
git checkout 4609b6731a01116e96e554140b37ad589f0ae0ca
mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
cp conf/janusgraph-cassandra-es.properties conf/janusgraph-cql-es.properties
```
* Make the following changes in conf/janusgraph-cql-es.properties:
```
storage.backend=cql
storage.hostname=x.x.x.x (your storage server ip)
index.search.hostname=x.x.x.x (your index server ip)
```

Install a REST client, such as RESTClient add-on for Firefox, on the client machine.

### 2. Clone the repo

Clone the `janusgraph-utils` on the graph server and run `mvn package`.

```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/janusgraph-utils.git
cd janusgraph-utils/
mvn package
```

### 3. Generate the graph sample

Run the command in `janusgraph-utils` folder to generate data into `/tmp` folder.
```
./run.sh gencsv csv-conf/twitter-like-w-date.json /tmp
```
Modify the generated user file under `/tmp` so the sample queries will return with data.
```
sed -i -e '2s/.*/1,Indiana Jones/' /tmp/User.csv
```
### 4. Load schema and import data

A graph schema can be loaded from either the Gremlin console or a java utility. You can check the
doc [doc/users_guide.md](doc/users_guide.md) for details. Alternatively, just run one command in `janusgraph-utils` folder to
load schema and import data.
```
export JANUSGRAPH_HOME=~/janusgraph
./run.sh import ~/janusgraph/conf/janusgraph-cql-es.properties /tmp /tmp/schema.json /tmp/datamapper.json
```

### 5. Run interactive remote queries

Configure JanusGraph server by running these commands:

```
cd ~/janusgraph/conf/gremlin-server
cp ~/janusgraph-utils/samples/date-helper.groovy ../../scripts
cp ../janusgraph-cql-es.properties janusgraph-cql-es-server.properties
cp gremlin-server.yaml rest-gremlin-server.yaml
```

Add this line to janusgraph-cql-es-server.properties:
```
gremlin.graph=org.janusgraph.core.JanusGraphFactory
```

Change the following four lines in rest-gremlin-server.yaml:
```
host: x.x.x.x (your server ip)
channelizer: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.channel.HttpChannelizer
graph: conf/gremlin-server/janusgraph-cql-es-server.properties}
scripts: [scripts/empty-sample.groovy,scripts/date-helper.groovy]}}
```

Start JanusGraph server:
```
cd ~/janusgraph; ./bin/gremlin-server.sh ./conf/gremlin-server/rest-gremlin-server.yaml
```

Now you can query and update graph data using REST. For example, send REST requests using RESTClient
in browser with following:
```
Method: POST
URL: http://x.x.x.x:8182
Body: {"gremlin":â€œquery_to_run"}
```
You can find sample search and insert queries in [samples/twitter-like-queries.txt](samples/twitter-like-queries.txt).
