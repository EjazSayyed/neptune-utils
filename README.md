# Develop a graph database app using Amazon Neptune

This Code Pattern contains sample data and code for running a Twitter-like application in Amazon Neptune. The utility code illustrates how to use Amazon Neptune APIs, ingest data, and query graph. Developers can use or modify the code to build and operate their custom graph applications, or create similar java and groovy files to interact with Amazon Neptune.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:
* Generate a synthetic graph dataset
* Upload graph dataset to Amazon S3
* Use Amazon Neptune Bulk Loader to import graph data in csv files into Amazon Neptune graph database
* Query and update graph data using Apache Gremlin Console and REST API

## Prerequisites

- Provision Amazon Neptune Cluster (single node)
- Create Amazon S3 bucket 
- Provision an Amazon EC2 instance with Instance Profile that allows to read/write to Amazon S3
- Install and configure Java and Maven on the above EC2 instance. For more details please visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/access-graph-gremlin-java.html. Follow previous doc link upto step#4.
- Install Apache Tinkerpop Gremlin client and configure the connectivity to Amazon Neptune as described here - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/access-graph-gremlin-console.html

## Flow

1. The user downloads neptune-utils from this gitHub repo
2. The user generates Twitter sample data using Neptune utilities (in Amazon S3)
3. The user loads this data into Amazon Neptune using Amazon Neptune Bulk Loader utility
4. The user makes search queries and update the graph using Apache Tinkerpop Gremlin client

## Features
* This is fully extensible code wherein developers can change the number/type of vertices and edges by modifying the config JSON files
* Sample large, medium and tiny config files are provided to test large (upto millions of vertices and edges), medium and small datasets.


# Steps
## Run locally
1. [Install prerequisites](#1-install-prerequisites)
2. [Clone the repo](#2-clone-the-repo)
3. [Generate the graph sample](#3-generate-the-graph-sample)
4. [Load schema and import data](#4-load-schema-and-import-data)
5. [Run interactive remote queries](#5-run-interactive-remote-queries)

### 1. Install prerequisites
Please install and configure all the softwares as mentioned in the prerequisites section above.
Note that Amazon Neptune is only accessible within a VPC. If you want to access Amazon Neptune instance from outside VPC consider implementing a reverse proxy solution in front of Amazon Netune.


### 2. Clone the repo

Clone the `neptune-utils` on the EC2 instance and run `mvn package`.

```
git clone https://github.com/EjazSayyed/neptune-utils.git
cd neptune-utils/
mvn package
```

### 3. Generate the graph sample

Run the command in `neptune-utils` folder to generate data into `/tmp` folder on a local filesystem and then upload it to the Amazon S3 bucket you would specify as an argument.
```
./run.sh gencsv csv-conf/twitter-like-w-date.json <s3-bucket> <bucket-folder>
```

### 4. Load schema and import data

A graph schema can be loaded from either the Gremlin console or a java utility. You can check the
doc [doc/users_guide.md](doc/users_guide.md) for details. Alternatively, just run one command in `janusgraph-utils` folder to
load schema and import data.
```
export JANUSGRAPH_HOME=~/janusgraph
./run.sh import ~/janusgraph/conf/janusgraph-cql-es.properties /tmp /tmp/schema.json /tmp/datamapper.json
```

### 5. Run interactive remote queries

Configure JanusGraph server by running these commands:

```
cd ~/janusgraph/conf/gremlin-server
cp ~/janusgraph-utils/samples/date-helper.groovy ../../scripts
cp ../janusgraph-cql-es.properties janusgraph-cql-es-server.properties
cp gremlin-server.yaml rest-gremlin-server.yaml
```

Add this line to janusgraph-cql-es-server.properties:
```
gremlin.graph=org.janusgraph.core.JanusGraphFactory
```

Change the following four lines in rest-gremlin-server.yaml:
```
host: x.x.x.x (your server ip)
channelizer: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.channel.HttpChannelizer
graph: conf/gremlin-server/janusgraph-cql-es-server.properties}
scripts: [scripts/empty-sample.groovy,scripts/date-helper.groovy]}}
```

Start JanusGraph server:
```
cd ~/janusgraph; ./bin/gremlin-server.sh ./conf/gremlin-server/rest-gremlin-server.yaml
```

Now you can query and update graph data using REST. For example, send REST requests using RESTClient
in browser with following:
```
Method: POST
URL: http://x.x.x.x:8182
Body: {"gremlin":â€œquery_to_run"}
```
You can find sample search and insert queries in [samples/twitter-like-queries.txt](samples/twitter-like-queries.txt).
